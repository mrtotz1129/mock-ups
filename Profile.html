<h1>Marine Medical</h1>
<p>Marine Medical Services was created in 1990 with a vision of providing world-class medical service to specifically meet and satisfy every repatriated seafarer’s need for medical attention. The Philippines has been known as a major provider of about 300,000 seafarers to man international ships. These seafarers are among those considered by the government as modern day heroes because they help keep our dwindling economy afloat. We take it as our humble contribution to our country’s progress to put up a unit that will cater to every seafarer’s medical needs in order to keep them physically and mentally fit so as not to compromise their jobs. Our beginnings were not without its peaks and valleys. The road to achieving our goals has never been easy but our desire and determination has made us overcome these hurdles and has made our vision turn into reality.</p>

We take it as our humble contribution to our country’s progress to put up a unit that will cater to every seafarer’s medical needs in order to keep them physically and mentally fit so as not to compromise their jobs. Our beginnings were not without its peaks and valleys. The road to achieving our goals has never been easy but our desire and determination has made us overcome these hurdles and has made our vision turn into reality.<br> 
For the past two decades, Marine Medical Services has enjoyed its lofty standing of being the largest clinic that caters exclusively to repatriated seafarers in need of medical assistance.<br>
<p>We have grown with the years in service and we believe that Marine Medical Services’ status would not be where it is now if not for the thousands of seafarers who have expressed satisfaction in our services and the countless support coming from the different manning agencies, the various P&I clubs and the foreign principals who have come and visited us.</p>
<p>It is therefore our utmost vision to maintain a company reputation untarnished by compromise as our contribution in keeping the maritime industry strong and stable. If we deemed it is necessary to come face to face with reality in the assessment of a disability for a particular seafarer, we arm ourselves with the objective findings based on the patient’s illness or injury. We don’t take sides and avoid the impression that our decisions may be influenced.<br>
Our company takes its vision by heart with the welfare of the seafarers we serve, the company that benefits from the seafarers’ service, and the country that we love, as a primary concern.</p>
