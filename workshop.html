<strong> Philippine Center for Advanced Surgery Holds First Minimally Invasive Surgery Workshop</strong></p>
<p>
A two-day training workshop was held prior to the inauguration of the Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) Training Center located on the fourth floor of the Philippine Center for Advanced Surgery (PCAS) at Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC). The workshop and hands-on training exercises last May 3 and 4 drew over 70 surgeons and medical practitioners from various hospitals all over the country.</p>
<p>
CSMC has been conducting MIS workshops since 2003 according to PCAS Executive Director Dr. Alfred Allen Buenafe. The doctor fondly recalled how they used to convert the hospital’s conference rooms and even its parking lot into a makeshift operating room to train young surgeons in the field of MIS. They would also borrow laparoscopy machines and laparoscopy towers to aid them in their training workshops.</p>
<p>
With the inauguration of the training center, Dr. Buenafe, envisions the succeeding generations of Filipino surgeons to be more globally competent and highly skilled in the field of advanced surgery without going abroad to train like what he did before.</p>
<p>
“What we’re trying to do now is build a center for Filipinos…if you look at the logo, the name of Cardinal Santos is small but the name of PCAS is big. The reason for that is our aim is to build the PCAS as a safe haven for everyone na walang exclusivity. Anyone, any institution can come in to do their training in PCAS,” said Dr. Buenafe.</p>
<p>MIS allow patients faster recovery time, less pain and scarring after operation, and shorter hospital stay compared to open surgery. The procedure makes use of specially designed laparoscopic and endoscopic instruments through very small incisions.</p>
<p>He added, “With the foundation of PCAS we can now shift the paradigm in training of surgeons. ‘See one, do one, teach one’ I think is unfair to our patients now. Practice makes perfect but I think it’s not anymore. Here in PCAS, we’ll provide you with a virtual learning environment. We have practice laboratories with the newest laparoscopic machines where we plant the idea that perfect practice makes for a perfect surgeon. Our vision is to provide our doctors, surgeons and physicians and other healthcare personnel of the different cutting specialties (and) the best educational program available.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Some words from doctors who participated in the first MIS training workshop held in PCAS:</strong></p>
<p>
<i>“We can go to advance training without having to go out of the country and that is tailored to the needs of the local doctors. It has very good facilities, it’s the same as the facilities outside, even the animal training lab is top grade,”</i> said Dr. Alembert Lee-Ong (Surgeon, Manila Doctors Hospital).<br><br>
<i>“This experience is very overwhelming and very useful for us kasi kami yung senior residents so after graduation, maganda siya para sa amin kasi kami yung humahawak ng ganitong kaso plus the fact na ‘pag graduate namin mababaon namin yung experience tsaka yung learning sa practice namin,”</i> Dr. Rizzah Agbay (General Surgery Chief Resident, Batangas Medical Center).<br><br>
<i>“The facilities here are great, everything is nice. I would probably ask PALES to always have their seminars, conventions, and trainings here in PCAS,”</i> said Dr. Edwin Bernardo (Surgeon, Medical City).<br><br>
<i>“It’s a good avenue for residents and consultants to learn about MIS. Since this is considered an advanced surgery, I think the initiative of this institution to come up with this center enables us to be at par with other institutions as well as other countries in surgery,”</i> said Dr. Amabelle Yuga (Surgery Resident, De La Salle University Medical Center).<br><br>
<i>“With the opening of our PCAS, we’ll be setting a new standard in training for advanced surgery in the country. I’ve been to other countries but certainly, the one we have in Cardinal Santos is one of the most technologically-advanced and complete in terms of minimally invasive surgery,”</i> said Dr. Popper John Dela Paz (Former Surgery Chief Resident, Cardinal Santos Medical Center).</p>
