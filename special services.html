                    <p-3>Marine Medical Services was created in 1990 with a vision of providing world-class medical service to specifically meet and satisfy every repatriated seafarer’s need for medical attention. The Philippines has been known as a major provider of about 300,000 seafarers to man international ships. These seafarers are among those considered by the government as modern day heroes because they help keep our dwindling economy afloat. We take it as our humble contribution to our country’s progress to put up a unit that will cater to every seafarer’s medical needs in order to keep them physically and mentally fit so as not to compromise their jobs. Our beginnings were not without its peaks and valleys. The road to achieving our goals has never been easy but our desire and determination has made us overcome these hurdles and has made our vision turn into reality.</p-3>

Our beginnings were not without its peaks and valleys. The road to achieving our goals has never been easy but our desire and determination has made us overcome these hurdles and has made our vision turn into reality.<br> 
                    For the past two decades, Marine Medical Services has enjoyed its lofty standing of being the largest clinic that caters exclusively to repatriated seafarers in need of medical assistance.<br></p-3>
                    <p-3>We have grown with the years in service and we believe that Marine Medical Services’ status would not be where it is now if not for the thousands of seafarers who have expressed satisfaction in our services and the countless support coming from the different manning agencies, the various P&I clubs and the foreign principals who have come and visited us.</p-3>
                    <p-3>It is therefore our utmost vision to maintain a company reputation untarnished by compromise as our contribution in keeping the maritime industry strong and stable. If we deemed it is necessary to come face to face with reality in the assessment of a disability for a particular seafarer, we arm ourselves with the objective findings based on the patient’s illness or injury. We don’t take sides and avoid the impression that our decisions may be influenced.<br>
                    Our company takes its vision by heart with the welfare of the seafarers we serve, the company that benefits from the seafarers’ service, and the country that we love, as a primary concern.</p-3>

                <h1>Cardinal MRI</h1>
                    <p-3><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)<br/>
                    What is MRI?</strong></p-3>
                    <p-3>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) combines the use of a magnetic field and radiowaves to produce high resolution images of the body to help doctors diagnose and treat various medical diseases.<br>
                    MRI produces images with superior soft tissue detail. In many cases, it is able to provide earlier and more accurate diagnosis of diseases when compared to standard x-rays, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT scan). Since MRI uses low energy waves and does not use radiation, the procedure is safe and can be repeated without side effects.</p-3>
                    <p-3><strong>Who needs an MRI scan?</strong><br>
                    Your doctor will decide whether an MRI scan is needed. MRI is commonly ordered to evaluate the following conditions:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stroke and Hemorrhage</li>
                        <li>Aneurysms and vascular malformations</li>
                        <li>Benign tumors and cancerous growths</li>
                        <li>Infectious and inflammatory diseases</li>
                        <li>Disc herniations and spinal canal stenosis</li>
                        <li>Muscoloskeletal injuries due to sports, accidents, and aging</li>
                    </ul></p-3>
                    <p-3><strong>Precautions</strong><br/>
                    Who cannot have an MRI scan?<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Patients with cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clips in the brain, and metallic foreign body in the eye cannot undergo an MRI</li>
                        <li>Patients with other metallic implants or devices should inform our staff to check if they are compatible with MRI scanning</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    Our 1.5T Siemens Espree MRI System has the shortest and widest magnet opening, giving you more headroom and elbowroom</p-3>
                    <p-3><strong>PATIENT INFORMATION</strong><br>
                    <strong>Do I need to do anything before my MRI and how long will the procedure take?</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For most examinations, no special preparation is needed prior the exam.</li>
                        <li>For abdominal studies, you will be asked to fast for at least 4 hours prior to the exam.</li>
                        <li>The exam usually takes 20 to 40 minutes for each part of the body to be scanned.</li>
                        <li>It is important to bring previous x-rays, ultrasound, CT and MRI films for comparison.</li>
                    </ul></p-3>

                <h1>Philippine Gamma Knife</h1>
                    <p-3><strong>Philippine Gamma Knife Center,Inc.<br>
                    (Brain Surgery Without Incision)</strong><br></p-3>
                    <p-3><strong>Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery</strong><br>
                    The Leksell Gamma Knife® is a stereotactic radiosurgical tool that delivers ionizing radiation to the brain to treat various diseases.  Developed by Professor Lars Leksell of Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, the Gamma Knife® provides patients with another option for the treatment of brain tumors, vascular malformations, trigeminal neuralgia and other conditions of the brain, especially deep-seated, that were once only managed with open surgery.</p-3>
                    <p-3>“… with a single dose of irradiation, it was possible to successfully destroy any deep brain structure without the risk of bleeding or infection.” – Dr. Lars Leksell<br></p-3>
                    <p-3>The Gamma Knife® has been in use for more than 50 years internationally, having treated more than 290,000 cases worldwide. In the Philippines, the only Leksell Gamma Knife® facility can be found at Cardinal Santos Medical Center. Since its inception in 1997, <strong>the Philippine Gamma Knife Center, Inc.</strong> has successfully treated over 2,000 cases and to this day continues to provide alternative treatment to brain surgery.</p-3>
                    <p-3>Other stereotactic services the Center offers are: aspiration of hematoma/abscess; implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt or reservoir; and biopsy.<br>
                    Backed by competent Filipino health professionals (neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists) and competent administrative staff, the Philippine Gamma Knife Center, Inc., is recognized as the “most comprehensive Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery Center in the Philippines”.  The Center recently expanded its capability to provide treatment to movement disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, Dystonia, and Essential Tremors by means of state-of-the-art stereotaxy, imaging, and microelectrode recording in deep brain stimulation surgery.  Thus, the Philippine Movement Disorder Surgery Center, Inc. was incorporated.</p-3>
                    <p-3><strong>Philippine Movement Disorder Surgery Center, Inc.<br>
                    (Moving on with Parkinson’s Disease)</strong><br></p-3>
                    <p-3><strong>Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery for Parkinson’s Disease, Dystonia, and Essential Tremors</strong><br>
                    The Philippine Movement Disorder Surgery Center, Inc. (PHILMOVE) is the first and only facility in the country offering state-of-the-art Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery (DBS) for movement disorders.</p-3>
                    <p-3>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) involves the precise implantation of an electrode deep into the brain using stereotactic techniques and the attachment of the electrode to a battery-powered programmable stimulator.  As an alternative procedure, pinpoint lesioning of deep brain nuclei could also be done using stereotactic techniques and a lesion generator to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders.  DBS is already the current standard in the surgical treatment of advanced Parkinson’s Disease, Dystonia, and Essential Tremor worldwide. Other indications for DBS like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders, Epilepsy, Tics, etc. are rapidly being developed.</p-3>
                    <p-3>Since it started in 2006, PHILMOVE had successfully implanted DBS devices in 16 patients with advanced idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease and Dystonia with zero morbidity.  In October 23, 2009, the first DBS procedure in Asia (fifth in the world) for X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism (XDP) was successfully done by PHILMOVE.  The initial success of the DBS procedure for XDP, a rapidly debilitating movement disorder endemic in Panay Island, Philippines brings hope to these long suffering patients who had no treatment available to them before the advent of DBS.</p-3>
                    <p-3>The Philippine Movement Disorder Surgery Center, Inc. (PHILMOVE) was founded in 2005 by a group of pioneering physicians with the intent of making available to the Filipino people readily-accessible and affordable facilities and expertise for movement disorder surgery.  In addition to Parkinson’s Disease, the country also has about 400 documented cases of familial X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism (XDP or DYT3), all of whom have no local access to neurosurgical treatment to address their severely debilitating condition.  PHILMOVE has now made it possible for these hundreds of Filipinos afflicted with XDP to undergo surgical treatment locally.<br></p-3>
