<strong>Why snoring is no laughing matter</strong></p>
<p>
<i>Get to know the real deal behind sleep disorders</i>
</p>
<p>
Case Scenario:  B.N. is a seven-year-old boy who is brought for consult because of sudden awakenings at night. The parent also reports of the child’s loud snoring, snorting, gasping, body jerks and moves his legs back and forth frequently during sleep. He is hard to wake in the morning. His teacher reports that he seems to be inattentive in class and unable to sit still. He is not under any medication. His blood pressure is elevated at 140/90.
</p>
<p>
When clinicians are faced with patients whose symptoms cannot be explained by just one disease, diagnostic procedures will definitely help in the diagnosis. Like with the case of B.N. whose loud snoring, snorting, gasping, difficulty waking up in the morning, inattentiveness, hyperactivity and hypertension point to an <strong>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The body jerks and sudden awakenings at night can be due to a <strong>Seizure Disorder or Parasomnia</strong>. Additionally, the back and forth movement of the legs may also be due to a movement disorder in sleep.
</p>
<p>
Diagnostic Polysomnography with end tidal pCO2 and a seizure study reveals high amplitude centro-temporal spike and wave discharges and an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) score of 8. This diagnostic procedure is called <strong>Sleep Study</strong> with an additional <strong>Seizure Study</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The procedure revealed that B.N. is suffering from a Seizure Disorder and Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Appropriate treatment has been given to him since and he is now reported to be excelling in class and his behavior significantly improved. His blood pressure went down to normal without the aid of any medication. He sleeps soundly and no longer disrupts the sleep of his parents.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>Long-Term Monitoring for Epilepsy (LTME) and Sleep Center</strong> of Cardinal Santos Medical Center is equipped with up-to-date technology and team of excellent doctors and staff catering to patients with Epilepsy and Sleep Disorders.
</p>
<p>
Sleep is so basic a function that for a long time it is being disregarded. However, it has been shown that sleep is so much more. Research in this field has exploded and it is now a subspecialty. Sleep problems affect every aspect of our health, daily functioning and well-being. It can be as serious as any major health problem, such as diabetes or heart disease. But what many people fail to realize is that sleep disorders are treatable and preventable.
</p>
<p>
The LTME and Sleep Center offers a wide array of diagnostic sleep tests which will aid clinicians and patients in further understanding their sleep complaints and guide them to proper management. Sleep Study, also known as <strong>Polysomnography</strong>, is done overnight. It monitors brain activity, snoring, breathing and respiratory effort, leg movement, heart rate and oxygen saturation.
</p><br>
<p>
<strong>Sleep Study</strong>
</p><br>
<p>
Snoring, sensation of  gasping or choking with sudden awakenings during the night,  difficulty getting up in the morning, daytime sleepiness, forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, irritability, sexual dysfunction – these are some of the many symptoms of <strong>Obstructive Sleep  Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Often, the first person to notice is the bed partner or housemates because most of the symptoms occur at night while the person afflicted with OSA is asleep. People with OSA have repeated episodes of partial or complete blockage of the upper airway during sleep, causing sleep disruptions resulting to poor quality sleep.
</p>
<p>
These episodes can decrease the flow of oxygen to vital organs causing a strain on your heart, lungs and circulatory system. There is increased risk for heart attack, hypertension, heart failure, metabolic syndrome and stroke.  Daytime sleepiness also increases the risk of road accidents at work and even at home.</p>
<p>
For children with OSA, health consequences include hypertension, poor concentration in school, inattentiveness, hyperactivity. When severe and not treated, it will lead to pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.
</p>
<p>
Polysomnography is the gold standard in the diagnosis of OSA. It can also help diagnose movement disorders in sleep, insomia, parasomia, and narcolepsy. Your doctor will ask you to undergo a Diagnostic Sleep Study to rule out OSA. Once diagnosed, depending on the case, the doctor will request for a Therapeutic Sleep Study.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to find the appropriate positive airway pressure to be applied to the nose or nose and mouth via a mask interface using a <strong>continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</strong> machine to prevent upper airway collapse during sleep.  Nightly use of CPAP will then be prescribed to eliminate apneas and snoring. Good compliance to CPAP use eliminates the bothersome symptoms and decreases the risks for health problems associated with OSA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)</strong> is a diagnostic test for narcolepsy often following an overnight sleep study. It is used to distinguish true excessive daytime sleepiness from physical tiredness or to assess whether treatments for breathing disorders are working. It is based on the idea that the sleepier the person is, the faster he will fall asleep. It measures the time elapsed from the start of a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep called sleep latency.
